/**
 * A brief run through of the architecture for this plugin; 
 * 
 * Manager is taksed with managing the plugin within Wordpress (activate, deactivate, regular cleanups of stale instances). 
 * Generator is a factory that produces demo instances when a user visits the site and deletes them in bulk once they expire. 
 * Instance is tasked with the heavy lifting when creating demos - copying tables and fixing prefixes, copying the media folder, etc. 
 * Configuration settings are placed in Config. Be very careful about changing these. Generally no changes should be needed.
 * Generate.php is there to keep most of the plugin's code out of wp-config.
 * Finally, this file is here to satisfy Wordpress itself.
